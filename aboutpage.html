  <h1> About Us</h1>
<h2> How we Started</h2>
  <p> We are three girls studying at Lancaster University, who are passionate about food and making life easier for students. We met when stuyding the CodeFirst: Girls course and started our business from there. We know how hard it is cooking for yourself when you first move away from home, so we thought being able to generate a recipe using ingredients you already have is an easier, cheaper and more convenient to way to cook. Therefore instead of choosing a recipe and going out to buy the ingredients, if you tell us the ingredients we'll choose the recipe for you!</p>
  <h2>Meet the Team!</h2>
<h3>Meet Camille</h3>
  <img src="Camille.jpg" alt="Camille">
  <p>I am 21 years old, studying Management at Lancaster University and I am from Paris. In the age of technology, I felt it was important to learn how to build websites since we are using them everyday. Creating Build My Recipe website was a great experience along with my two team members. I really hope you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>
<h3>Meet Liv</h3>
  <img src="liv.jpeg" alt="Liv">
  <p>I'm 19 years old, studying Marketing at Lancaster University. I'm from Manchester, the very city where I did work experience with a data analyst company which inspired me to do the CF: G course! I am passionate about cooking (and eating!) and creating Build my Recipe with Camille and Christine allowed me to pass this love on to others.</p>
<h3>Meet Christine</h3>
  <p>I'm Christine, I'm 20 and I study Computer Science. I'm from Romania and I always had a passion for computers. I started coding when I was 14 and I've loved it ever since, so I did the CF: G course to improve my skills. I'm not very good at cooking and I wish I'd had a website like Build my Recipe when I first moved away from home, so instead it can help you!</p>
